1,3,2,1,4,4,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,4,"For the trial with visual interface, the haptic feedback device provided a strong incentive for the path I should take to the target. For example, in the cases where I had to move more laterally than vertically to reach a target, the strong buzz to move laterally (e.g. to the right) made me move laterally before moving vertically. In the case of without feedback, I felt like the device produced relatively successful navigation. However, the efficiency of navigation felt like it decreases. I believe making the vibration stronger in the no visual case would improve performance. ","I believe it could be an effective mode of feedback on top of visual queues for precise navigation. When it comes to achieving a precise location, the haptic feedback felt like it helped me zero in on the exact location of the target. I think this could be beneficial in helping pilots for stabilization, precise landing, and alerts (especially when pilots are faced with high workload).","Make the vibrations stronger, and have different frequencies or vibration types for the horizontal and vertical directions. It felt difficult to distinguish up and right when they were both buzzing equally. It feels like pants could be dappen and mix the vibrations, resulting in less effective navigation signaling."
2,3,2,4,4,3,4,5,4,3,4,5,5,4,3,3,"Haptic feedback helped with and without visual interface, and is an interesting way to give a user more prompting when playing the game.",I do.,It was at times hard to tell which sensors were 'buzzing' and so I had to feel with my hands sometimes on which one was 'buzzing.'
3,2,2,4,5,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,4,2,3,2,"Still felt like it was more of a struggle than with the visual interface, but it was definitely still doable. A couple of times the side to side was a bit confusing as I was not sure if it wanted me to move over more or if I was in the zone. During the time when I had visual and haptics, I noticed that I was still getting some feedback while I was in the zone.",Yes I believe this could be extremely useful once refined and learned by pilots.,I would suggest positioning be explored and feedback be decreased or stopped when in the green zone to prevent confusion on if further adjustments are needed.
4,5,2,2,4,3,3,4,4,3,5,5,1,5,5,2,"The signal was sometimes difficult to distinguish between different nodes. I found the most effective way was to follow an input until I felt the opposing signal and then refine the inputs, which probably isn't a great way to actually pilot an aircraft. The different intensities of the signal was helpful though. ",Yes I think there's a lot of applicability in this field.,"Testing different configurations and different types of information would always be interesting, super exciting project though!"
5,3,2,1,4,4,4,5,2,3,3,4,3,4,4,2,"I would say haptic feedback devices could be an effective navigation aid; however, I feel like other feedback would enable greater navigation ability. For instance, I think the device I used did not provide strong enough feedback. But I also, think stronger feedback might hinder navigation ability therefore, multiple types of feedback may be more effective.","Potentially, I feel like UAVs are very sensitive to control and utilizing vibration as haptic feedback may hinder precise control of a UAV. Nevertheless, it might be useful if a pilot became blinded (maybe by light or something else).","I would look into the use of multiple haptic feedback mechanisms for this project. In addition, audio instructions would be an interesting method to compare haptic feedback with. In addition, I don't think I reached the waypoint on the haptic feedback only task and that might affect the data. As such, it would also be interesting to incorporate a means to test multiple waypoints with haptic feedback and compare how close I got to each target."
